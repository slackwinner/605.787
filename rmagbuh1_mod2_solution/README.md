        - Note: When I validated "index.html" with W3C Validator tool, I got a warning saying 
                "This document appears to be Lorem ipsum text. Consider adding lang="zxx" (or variant) to the html start tag." I checked Stack Overflow to see what other developers have done to fix this issue and some suggested adding lang="zxx" to the html tag. Therefore I went with this solution, to fix the warning.
